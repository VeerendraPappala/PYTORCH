# PYTORCH

* PyTorch is a Python based scientific computing package that is similar to NumPy, but with the added power of GPUs. It is also a deep learning framework that provides maximum flexibility and speed during implementing and building deep neural network architectures.

* A PyTorch implementation of a neural network looks exactly like a NumPy implementation. The goal of this section is to showcase the equivalent nature of PyTorch and NumPy. 

* A neural network can be defined and trained in four key steps:

  * Forward Propagation
  * Loss computation
  * Backpropagation
  * Updating the parameters

There are plenty of other use cases where PyTorch can, and has been used. It has quickly become the darling of researchers around the globe. The majority of the open source libraries and developments you’ll see happening nowadays have a PyTorch implementation available on GitHub.
    
## RESNET - FASTAI - PYTORCH:

transfer learning using a ResNet34 convolutional neural network pretrained on the ImageNet dataset.
The general approach to solving computer vision problems that i heard is fast.ai.  Fastai, a deep learning library built on top of PyTorch. It provides easy to use building blocks for training deep learning models.

### DATA:
  The dataset consists of two parts: a training set and a test set. The training set contains 39209 images of traffic signs classified into 43 classes, such as stop sign, bicycles crossing, and speed limit 30 km/h. 
 The dataset is very imbalanced. For example, there are 1800 instances of “speed limit (50 km/h)” sign, but just 168 instances of “dangerous curve to the left” sign.
The test set has 12630 labeled images. 
You can download the dataset from the [official website](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset)
